This is an updated version of [[https://github.com/NottingHack/instrumentation-arduino/tree/main/LaserDisplay][LaserDisplay]] for Nottingham Hackspace
after the previous one failed for a few reasons (Arduino Due issues,
broken solder joints after a fall, etc). The previous version was on a
perf board so I decided to make a PCB. I also decided to include a
WizNet, which I haven't tested yet.
